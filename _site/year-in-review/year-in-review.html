<p>One of the most significant changes of the year was the retirement of Theta, Cooley, and the theta-fs0 storage systems. They were great systems that helped our users accomplish a lot of science. From the operations perspective, there is a silver lining in that it reduces the number of systems and makes our operational environment more uniform without them, but it is still sad to see them go.</p>

<p>We made some significant improvements to our systems over the course of the year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ALCF AI Testbed’s Graphcore and Groq systems were made available for use and all four publicly available tested systems (Cerebras, SambaNova, Groq, and Graphcore) got significant upgrades.</li>
  <li>Polaris network hardware was upgraded from Slingshot 10 to Slingshot 11, doubling the max theoretical bandwidth. We are working on system software upgrades that will include the Slingshot software, programming environment, and Nvidia drivers.</li>
  <li>The HPSS disk cache was increased from 1PB to 9PB, significantly improving the probability of a “cache hit” and faster data retrieval.</li>
</ul>

<p>Operationally, we continue to work on expanding our support for an integrated research infrastructure (IRI). Much of our initial work was with Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source, and while we continue to work with them, we are also collaborating with other facilities. From the operations side, we are working to make it faster and easier to create new on-demand endpoints. This includes making the endpoints more robust and easier for scientists to manage.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, the Operations team has been decisively engaged in the Aurora bring up. We have done extensive work to assist in the stabilization efforts. We continue to work on developing software and processes to manage the gargantuan amount of log and telemetry that the system produces. We have provided support for scheduling. Our system admins have developed extensive prolog and epilogue hooks to detect and, where possible, automatically remediate known issues on the system while the vendors work on permanent resolution. We have also assisted in supporting the user community. Because of the NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) requirements, we set up a special Slack instance to facilitate discussion and have assisted in conducting training.</p>

<p>We continue to collaborate with Altair Engineering and the OpenPBS community. We found some scale-related bugs that were making administration on Aurora slow and difficult. We worked closely with Altair and they provided patch updates very quickly and integrated those fixes into the production releases. We continued our work on porting PBS to the AI Testbed systems, but their unique hardware architectures and constraints have been challenging. However, later in the year, we were forced to table the AI system work and focus on Aurora.</p>

<h1 id="kalyan-kumaran-alcf-director-of-technology">Kalyan Kumaran, ALCF Director of Technology</h1>

<p>In 2022, we made significant progress in our efforts to stand up Aurora. Our team continued its collaborations with Intel on the non-recurring engineering (NRE) contract and our work with applications development teams participating in DOE’s Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and the Aurora Early Science Program (ESP).</p>

<p>The collaborative efforts led to a number of highlights: standing up another Aurora testbed, Florentia, which features Intel’s Data Center GPU Max, for ESP and ECP users via our Joint Laboratory for System Evaluation; making significant progress in oneAPI development especially in compilers, math libraries, and AI frameworks; and advancing application porting efforts for Aurora.</p>

<p>To push portable programming models across various ecosystems, our team worked on supporting SYCL and HIP on all DOE supercomputers. We also made a concentrated effort to provide more training opportunities to prepare users for Aurora and Polaris. Topics for the ALCF’s monthly webinars specifically targeted the programming models, performance tools, I/O, and AI software that will be available on these systems. Our teams also led workshops and sessions on SYCL/DPC++ and DAOS at computing events like SC22 and the ECP Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>In the AI space, our staff contributed to the MLPerf HPC, Storage and Science benchmarks. The deep-learning I/O benchmarking tool has been adopted by the MLPerf Storage community for benchmarking AI systems. The team helped deploy two AI accelerators, Cerebras and SambaNova, in production for the open-science community. We continued to grow the ALCF AI Testbed, adding new AI accelerators and conducting several workshops on how to effectively use the systems for science, Including a tutorial at SC’22. The team also hosted the ALCF AI for Science Training Series to teach a new generation of researchers how to use supercomputers for AI research.</p>

<p>I’m proud that the Technology team’s staff members were part of the winning team for the Gordon Bell Special Prize for COVID-19 Research at SC22, and our visualization team was a finalist for the Best Visualization in the SC22 Scientific Visualization &amp; Data Analytics Showcase. Overall, our team has adapted well to work in a hybrid environment and continues to support our users in their pursuit of scientific discoveries.</p>

<p>It was a busy year for the ALCF as we continued to make strides in deploying new systems, tools, and capabilities to support HPC- and AI-driven scientific research, while also broadening our outreach efforts to engage with new communities. In the outreach space, we partnered with colleagues at the Exascale Computing Project, NERSC, OLCF, and the Sustainable Horizons Institute to host DOE’s first “Intro to HPC Bootcamp.” With an emphasis on energy justice and workforce development, the event welcomed around 60 college students (many with little to no background in scientific computing) to use HPC for hands-on projects focused on making positive social impacts. It was very gratifying to see how engaged the students were in this immersive, week-long event. The bootcamp is a great addition to our extensive outreach efforts aimed at cultivating the next-generation computing workforce.</p>

<p>Our ongoing efforts to develop an integrated research infrastructure (IRI) also got a boost this year. As a member DOE’s IRI Task Force and IRI Blueprint Activity over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues across the national labs to formulate a long-term strategy for integrating computing facilities like the ALCF with data-intensive experimental facilities. In 2023, we released the IRI Architecture Blueprint Activity Report, which lays out a framework for moving ahead with coordinated implementation efforts across DOE. At the same time, the ALCF continued to build on its long history of developing and demonstrating tools and methods to integrate our supercomputers with experimental facilities, such as Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source and the DIII-D. This year, Argonne launched the Nexus effort to coordinate all of the lab’s research activities and partnerships in this domain, ensuring they align with DOE’s broader IRI vision.</p>

<p>We also made progress toward introducing the Argonne Enterprise Registration System, a new lab-wide registration platform aimed at standardizing data collection and processing for various categories of non-employees, including facility users. In 2023, we defined system requirements and issued a request for proposals for building the platform. Ultimately, the new system will help eliminate redundant data entry, simplify registration processes for both users and staff, and enhance our reporting capabilities.</p>

<p>As a final note on 2023, we kicked off our ALCF-4 efforts to plan for our next-generation supercomputer, with DOE approving the CD-0 (Critical Decision-O) mission need for the project in April. We also established the leadership team (with myself as the project director and Kevin Harms as technical director) and began conversations with vendors to discuss their technology roadmaps. We look forward to ramping up the ALCF-4 project in 2024.</p>

<p>It was another exciting year for science at the ALCF. We supported dozens of projects through DOE’s INCITE, ALCC and Early Science programs, and many more through our Director’s Discretionary program. Our user community produced over 200 publications this year, many of which were highlighted in our monthly presentations to DOE and featured in articles on our website.</p>

<p>One notable highlight is a collaborative project between Argonne and 3M that used simulations and machine learning to optimize the production of melt-blown nonwoven materials for various fabrics and filters, including N95 masks. Another project led by researchers at the University of College London coupled an ensemble simulation-based sampling method with machine learning to speed up the search for promising drug candidates to combat COVID-19 and other viruses. As a final example, an Argonne team used Theta to gain insights into battery material performance, leading to the discovery of a new battery electrolyte that can hold significantly more water than conventional electrolytes. Their study, which included experimental validation, provides a potential pathway to producing lower-cost and more environmentally friendly batteries.</p>

<p>With Aurora nearing completion, we also continued to make progress toward ensuring the system is ready for science as soon as it is released to the user community. Research teams from the Aurora Early Science Program and DOE’s Exascale Computing Project are on the front line of the Aurora application development efforts. They continued working closely with ALCF staff to port and optimize codes and software for Aurora using early hardware, including the new Sunspot testbed. Training is also a big part of preparing users for Aurora, with both the ALCF and ECP hosting workshops, tutorials, webinars, and hackathons to ready researchers for science in the exascale era. We’re so excited to finally see Aurora in action when the Early Science teams begin carrying out their research campaigns next year. Aurora, along with our newest computing resources, Polaris and the ALCF AI Testbed, are going to power some exciting discoveries by taking the convergence of simulation, data analysis, and AI methods to a whole new level.</p>
