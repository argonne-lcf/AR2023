The ALCF's Industry Partnerships Program is designed to expand the facility’s community of industry users by engaging with companies of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 corporations, that could benefit from ALCF computing systems and expertise. 

With state-of-the-art simulation, data analysis, and machine learning capabilities, ALCF supercomputing and AI resources enable companies to tackle R&D challenges that are too computationally demanding for traditional computing clusters. Access to ALCF systems allows industry researchers to create higher-fidelity models, achieve more accurate predictions, and quickly analyze massive amounts of data. The results enable companies to accelerate critical breakthroughs, verify uncertainties, and reduce the need to build costly prototypes.

The ALCF has strengthened its industry outreach efforts through collaborations with other Argonne user facilities and divisions, including the Science and Technology Partnership Outreach (STPO) division. This approach has offered a more comprehensive understanding of the laboratory's resources, resulting in increased engagement with a number of companies.

Furthermore, the ALCF continued to play an active role in guiding the DOE Exascale Computing Project’s Industry and Agency Council, an advisory group comprising senior executives from leading U.S. companies and government agencies. This collaboration focused on deploying exascale computing to enhance products and services, fostering innovation and advancement in various industries.

Ultimately, ALCF-industry collaborations help to stimulate technological and engineering advances while bolstering the nation’s innovation infrastructure.

# Driving Innovation for Industry

Here are some examples of how ALCF resources are helping companies to advance their R&D efforts.

## 3M Reduces Improves Energy Efficiency of Manufacturing Process 
As part of DOE’s HPC for Energy Innovation (HPC4EI) program, researchers from 3M are working with Argonne to leverage ALCF supercomputers and AI to improve the energy efficiency of a manufacturing process used to produce melt-blown nonwoven materials. This extremely energy-intensive process is widely used by 3M to produce filters, fabrics, and insulation materials, as well as the N95 mask used for protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. By using ALCF computing resources to pair computational fluid dynamics simulations and machine learning techniques, the Argonne-3M collaboration is working to reduce energy consumption by 20% without compromising material quality.

## TAE Technologies Advances Fusion Energy Research
Researchers from TAE Technologies are collaborating with the ALCF to accelerate their experimental research program, which is aimed at developing a clean, commercially viable, fusion-based electricity generator. The team’s simulation results are being used to optimize a device for studying the confinement of energy with high plasma temperatures, and to inform the design of a future prototype reactor.

## ComEd Prepares for the Impacts of Climate Change
The ComEd energy company is partnering with Argonne to understand and prepare for the impacts of climate change. The team is using ALCF resources to dynamically downscale global climate models, providing projections and analysis for more localized areas. Their work is providing an understanding of how climate change may affect ComEd’s distribution grid and highlights the need for strategies that adapt to future climate conditions.

## Dow Chemical Employs HPC and ML to Optimize Manufacturing Equipment
Dow Chemical is working with Argonne on a HPC4EI project aimed at optimizing the efficiency of gas-liquid turbulent jet mixers used in chemical manufacturing. The team is using machine learning (ML) techniques in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics simulations to speed up and improve design optimization for its advanced mixing equipment. Ultimately, the team’s work will lead to an efficient framework combining ML and HPC for optimizing process equipment, and will provide a demonstration case for ML approaches to enable wider adoption across the chemical industry.

## Raytheon Develops ML Models to Improve High-Efficiency Gas Turbines 
With support from the HPC4EI program, researchers from Raytheon Technologies are working with Argonne to develop machine learning models for designing and optimizing high-efficiency gas turbines in aircraft. The machine learning models have been trained on computational fluid dynamics simulations of gas turbine film cooling performed on ALCF supercomputers. The team’s framework aims to help the company extend the fuel efficiency and durability of aircraft engines while reducing design times and costs.

## Solar Turbines Models Carbon Capture Technology for Use in Industrial Gas Turbines
Researchers from Solar Turbines Inc. are partnering with Argonne on an HPC4EI project aimed at modeling cost-effective carbon capture technologies for industrial gas turbines used for power generation, marine propulsion, and oil and gas production. With the goal of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the team is using high-fidelity large eddy simulation-based modeling to optimize the performance of a novel carbon capture system on Solar Turbines’ industrial gas turbines. Through this project, the company aims to shave months or even years off the product testing and development process, helping to accelerate the time-to-adoption of this promising new technology.

## Aramco Americas and Convergent Science Develop Design Process for Hydrogen Engines 
In a collaborative project between Aramco Americas, Convergent Science, and Argonne, researchers are using ALCF resources to carry out large-scale computational fluid dynamics simulations of ultra-high-efficiency hydrogen propulsion systems. As part of their work, the team has developed a high-fidelity, HPC-enabled analysis-led design process to accelerate the advancement of such systems. Ultimately, their work seeks to help decarbonize the transportation sector by expediting the adoption of clean, highly efficient hydrogen propulsion systems.
