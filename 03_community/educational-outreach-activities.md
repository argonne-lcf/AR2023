# ALCF Student Summer Program
Every summer, the ALCF opens its doors to a new class of student researchers who work alongside staff mentors to tackle research projects that address issues at the forefront of scientific computing. The facility hosted more than 40 students ranging from high school seniors to Ph.D. candidates. Studying topics such as exploring scientific data in virtual reality, advancing X-ray imaging of brain tissue, and improving application memory performance, the interns had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with some of the most advanced computing technologies in the world. 

# Argonne Open House
For one day only in 2023, Argonne National Laboratory opened its doors to the public. At the Argonne Open House guest spent the day thinking and acting like a scientist and discovering how science helps answer the biggest questions facing humanity. The free event sold out and saw guest participating in a wide-variety of engaging, hands-on, science-focused activities. Guest explored the lab’s campus in specially designed tours that offered a rare sneak peek into the world-class facilities and met with accomplished scientists to learn how they are developing batteries that will power the next generation of electric vehicles, discovering new ways to stop future pandemics like COVID-19, detecting new particles, and designing clean energy solutions that protect our planet from climate change.

# Coding for Science Camp
In July, Argonne hosted its Coding for Science Camp for 30 high school freshmen and sophomores who were new to coding. The week-long camp, a joint initiative of Argonne’s Educational Programs Office and the ALCF, promotes problem solving and teamwork skills through hands-on coding activities, such as coding with Python and programming a robot, and interactions with Argonne staff members working in HPC and visualization.

# CSEdWeek
As part of the national Computer Science Education Week (CSEdWeek) and the Hour of Code in December, ALCF staff members provide virtual talks and demos to Chicago area schools to spark interest in computer science. Working with students in classes from elementary to high school, the volunteers led a variety of activities designed to teach the basics of coding. CSEdWeek was established by Congress in 2009 to raise awareness about the need to elevate computer science education at all levels.

# Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day  
ALCF staff members regularly serve as mentors and volunteers for Argonne’s Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day (IGED) program. The annual event gives eighth-grade students a unique opportunity to discover engineering careers alongside Argonne’s world-class scientists and engineers. Participants hear motivational presentations by Argonne engineers, tour the lab’s cutting-edge research facilities, connect with mentors, engage in hands-on engineering experiments, and compete in a team challenge.

# OneAPI Academic Hands-on Workshop
In October, nearly 100 undergraduate students from Chicagoland universities attended an all-day Intel oneAPI workshop hosted at Loyola University. Students had the opportunity to network with peers from other schools, professors, and experts from the ALCF. One highlight from the event was a graduate student panel, during which students had the opportunity to ask panelists about their work and paths to HPC.

# Science Careers in Search of Women
ALCF staff members continued to contribute to Argonne’s annual Science Careers in Search of Women (SCSW) conference. The event hosts female high school students for a day of inspiring lectures, facility tours, career booth exhibits, and mentoring. SCSW provides participants with the unique experience to explore their desired profession or area of interest through interaction with Argonne’s women scientists and engineers.
