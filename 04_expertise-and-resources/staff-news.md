# ALCF Team Awarded Most Outstanding Paper at 2023 IWOCL & SYCLcon

ALCF researchers authored a study that was recognized as the Most Outstanding Paper at the 2023 IWOCL & SYCLcon conference. Led by ALCF’s Thomas Applencourt, the team included ALCF colleagues Kevin Harms, Brice Videau, and Nevin Liber, as well as Bryce Allen of Argonne/University of Chicago, Amanda Dufek of NERSC, and Jefferson le Quellec and Aiden Belton-Schure of Codeplay. The team’s paper, “Standardizing complex numbers in SYCL,” provides an open-source library of complex numbers and associated math functions that can be used in computations carried out with SYCL, a key programming framework for next-generation supercomputers, including the ALCF’s Aurora exascale system. 

# ALCF Team Receives Best Paper Award at ISAV 2023 Workshop

An ALCF-led team was recognized with the Best Paper Award at the 2023 In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV) Workshop at the SC23 conference. Led by ALCF’s Victor Mateevitsi, the team included ALCF colleagues Joseph Insley, Michael Papka, Saumil Patel, and Silvio Rizzi; Nicola Ferrier, Paul Fischer, Yu-Hsiang Lan, and Misun Min of Argonne; and Mathis Bode, Jens Henrik Göbbert, and Jonathan Windgassen of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) in Germany. Their paper, “Scaling Computational Fluid Dynamics: In Situ Visualization of NekRS using SENSEI,” detailed efforts to equip the NekRS computational fluid dynamics code with in situ analysis and visualization capabilities. 

# ALCF Team Wins First Place and Best Workflow at 2023 IEEE SciVis Contest

An ALCF team won first place and best workflow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) 2023 SciVis Contest for their development of a multi-platform scientific visualization application for analyzing data from brain plasticity simulations. Led by Tommy Marrinan of the ALCF and the University of St. Thomas, the team included ALCF colleagues Victor Mateevitsi and Michael Papka, and University of St. Thomas students Madeleine Moeller and Alina Kanayinkal. Their paper, “VisAnywhere: Developing Multi-platform Scientific Visualization Applications,” demonstrated how a single codebase can be adapted to develop visualization applications that run on a variety of display technologies, including mobile devices, laptops, high-resolution display walls, and virtual reality headsets. 

# ALCF-SWIFT Collaboration Recognized with Argonne Delivering Impact Award

As part of Argonne National Laboratory's 2023 Commercialization Excellence Awards, ALCF researchers Venkatram Vishwanath, Michael Papka, William Allcock, and Filippo Simini were recognized with a Delivering Impact Award for their collaboration with SWIFT, a global provider of financial messaging services. The collaborative effort leveraged ALCF’s supercomputing and AI resources to explore SWIFT’s synthetic transactional data streams and identify patterns, including any anomalous activity. The pattern-detection methods developed by the ALCF team provided SWIFT with the capabilities to respond to anomalies more rapidly, thereby strengthening financial infrastructure.

# Balin Receives Argonne Postdoctoral Performance Award

Riccardo Balin, a postdoctoral researcher at the ALCF, received a Postdoctoral Performance Award at Argonne National Laboratory's Postdoctoral Research and Career Symposium in November. Balin was recognized for his innovative work in coupling high-fidelity aerodynamic flow simulations with machine learning to improve modeling capabilities for aerospace engineering.

# Papka Named ACM Distinguished Member

ALCF Director Michael Papka was named a 2023 Distinguished Member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Papka was recognized for his contributions in virtual reality, collaborative environments, scientific visualization, as well as research and operations in high-performance computing. 

# Papka Receives Distinguished Performance Award

ALCF Director Michael Papka received the Distinguished Performance Award at the Argonne Board of Governors’ awards ceremony in September. Papka was recognized for his numerous exemplary contributions to Argonne, including his efforts to help build world-class scientific computing capabilities for open science.
