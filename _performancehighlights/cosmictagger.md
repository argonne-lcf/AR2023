# Challenge

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.





# Performance Results
Running the code on 512 nodes of Aurora achieved 83 percent scaling efficiency per node, using PyTorch and the distributed deep learning training framework Horovod. Running on Sunspot CosmicTagger achieved node throughput of 280 samples per second, a more than fivefold increase over other systems' throughput.


# Impact

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
